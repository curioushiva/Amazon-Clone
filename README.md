Amazon Website Clone

Hi! If you're reading this, welcome to my project! This is a frontend page of the famous Amazon shopping website that I built using only HTML and CSS. This isn't my first web development project as a beginner, but it's the first one I'm sharing publicly.

(if cloning, best view at Desktop Mode)

If you have any feedback or suggestions for improvement, please feel free to share them!

Thank you! :)
