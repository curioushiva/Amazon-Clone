# Amazon Website Clone

Hi! If you're reading this, welcome to my project! This is a homepage of the famous Amazon shopping website that I built using only HTML and CSS. This isn't my first web development project as a beginner, but it's the first one I'm sharing publicly.

(if cloning, best view at Desktop Mode)

## Website 

You can access the web clone [Curiosity - Studio ](https://mycuriosity.netlify.app/webpages/amazonclone/) from here 


If you have any feedback or suggestions for improvement, please feel free to share them!

Thank you! :)
